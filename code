Import the sorted 2010 Mismanaged Plastic Waste
% Mismanaged plastic waste data was imported for the top 30 most polluting countries.
MPWpC=xlsread('Jambeck et al 2015 Country List sorted.xlsx','M2:M31');

% In this model, we will assume that only 0.5% of plastic waste ends up in the oceans.
% This is based on Weiss et al. (2021) who claim that plastic influx values
% have been inflated in previous literature, which gave rise to the
% 'missing sink' concept.

Calculating the sum of plastic input per ocean
MPWIO2010 = sum(MPWOpC(strcmp(OceanList,'Indian')));
MPWAO2010 = sum(MPWOpC(strcmp(OceanList,'Atlantic')));
MPWSPO2010 = sum(MPWOpC(strcmp(OceanList,'Pacific South')));
MPWNPO2010 = sum(MPWOpC(strcmp(OceanList,'Pacific North')));
Reconstructing historic plastic flux
% We will assume that plastic pollution started in 1970 (Jambeck et al.2015), and a linear growth of plastic
% was observed until 2010.
% A for-loop will be used to reconstruct this.
t=1970;
for i=1:40;
t(i+1)=t(i)+1;
MPWIO(i+1) = MPWIO2010/40 * i;
MPWAO(i+1) = MPWAO2010/40 * i;
MPWSPO(i+1) = MPWSPO2010/40 * i;
MPWNPO(i+1) = MPWNPO2010/40 * i;
